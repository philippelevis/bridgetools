a minecraft 1.20.1 mod that automates brigding in a legit-looking way (legit scaffold), afaik the only one of its kind.

if anyone makes a clickgui for this it'll be really appreciated as i do not know shit about java rendering

as of right now has ninja(aka shift-unshift) and fruitberries (jump into the void and double clutch)
